# 5 Grid containers

```css
display: grid|inline-grid;
```
- `grid`: container is in a _"block-layout"_
- `inline-grid`: container is in _"inline-layout"_


Grid container has its own formatting context internally, aka _grid formatting context_

- _"Grid Items"_ that have css "float: ..." and "clear:..." set. these css properties will be ignored
- `vertical-align` css is ignored on a _"grid item"_
- `::first-line` and `::first-letter` pseudo elements do not apply to _"grid containers"_ neither do grid containers contribute a _"first formatted line"_ or _"first formatted letter"_ to their ancestors
- if the container is `display: inline-grid` and the container is floated `float:...` then the computer value of `display` becomes `display:grid`

## 5.2 Sizing Grid Containers

- in block formatting context the container is sized like a _"block-box"_
- in inline-level box it is sized as an _"atomic inline-level box"_ (like in an `inline-block`)
- grid container block size `auto` is always `max-content` size
- `max-content` size is the size of the sum of container track sizes+gutters when the grid is sized under _"max-content constraint"_
- `min-content` size is the size of the sum of container track sizes+gutters when the grid is sized under _"min-content constraint"_
  
## 5.3 Scrollable Grid Overflow

- `overflow` applies
- _"grid container"_ becomes a _"scroll container"_

## 5.4 Limiting Large Grids

UA (User Agent) can clamp a grid to [-10000, 10000]

If UA clamps grid tracks at 1000 then  (aka the last track is from 1000 to 1001)

```bash
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 
   1   2   3   4   5

   track 4 is from line 4 to line 5
```

`grid-row: 500/1500` will become  `grid-row: 500/1001`
`grid-column: 2000/3000` will become `grid-column: 1000/1001`
