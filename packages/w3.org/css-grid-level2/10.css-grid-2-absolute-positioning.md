# 10. Absolute Positioning

## 10.1. With a Grid Container as Containing Block

1. Containing block is GENERATED by the _grid container_
2. The containing grid = area corresponding to the grid placement properties
3. **Absolute grid item do not participate in the layout of the grid!!**
4. `left`,`right`,`top`,`bottom` work as usual
5. absolutely positioned items use _augmented grid_
6. `left`,`right`,`top`,`bottom` remain the same regardless of writing mode
7. absolute positioning occurs after explicit & implicit grid layout
8. absolute positioning will not create new grid lines
9. absolutely-positioned child of a grid container is out-of-flow and not a grid item.

Example 44:

```css
.grid {
    /*  4 equal-height rows filling the grid container,
        4 columns of 10rem each */
    grid: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr / 10rem 10rem 10rem 10rem;
    
    /* center the grid horizontally within the grid container */
    justify-content: center;
    
    /* Establish abspos containing block */  
    position: relative;
}

.abspos {
  
  /* 1st grid row line = top of grid container */
  grid-row-start: 1;    

  /* 3rd grid row line */
  grid-row-end: span 2;  
  
  /* 3rd grid col line */
  grid-column-start: 3;  
  
  /* right padding edge, (augmented grid)  */
  grid-column-end: auto; 
  
  /* Containing block covers the top right quadrant of the grid container */
  position: absolute;
  top: 70px;
  bottom: 40px;
  left: 100px;
  right: 30px;
}
```
## 10.2 With a Grid Container as Parent

This one makes no sense, is a _containing block_ not a _parent_? Or maybe _containing block_ can mean "not immediate parent"?
