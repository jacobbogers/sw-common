
# 11 Alignment and spacing

By default, _grid items_ stretch to fill their _grid area_.

- IF `justify-self` or `align-self` compute to a value other than `stretch` or `margins` are `auto` THEN
  -  _grid items_ will _auto-size_ to fit their contents.
-  END

## 11.1 Gutters: the `row-gap`, `column-ga`p, and `gap` properties

- long-hand: `gap`
- short-hand: `row-gap`, `column-gap`
- Define _gutters_ between grid rows and grid columns.
- Gutters only appear between tracks of the implicit grid.
- there is no gutter before the first track or after the last track.

Values are:
- `normal`: for the grid this is 0px
- `<length-percentage>`

Shorthand `gap` = `<row-gap-value>` `<column-gap-value>`


## 11.2. Aligning with auto margins

- Auto margins on grid items similar to auto margins in block flow.
- Auto margins absorb positive free space prior to alignment `justify-content`, `align-content`, `justify-item`, `align-item`.
- Overflowing elements ignore their auto margins.

## 11.3. Inline-axis Alignment: the `justify-self` and `justify-items` properties

All alignment keywords you can find [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#alignment-values).

`justify-items` sets the default value for `justify-self` for all _grid-items_ 
- `justify-self`: In grid layouts, it aligns an item inside its grid area on the _inline axis_.
  - common values are:
    - `stretch` (default)
    - `center`
    - `start`
    - `end`
  - Value catogires:
    - **positional alignment**: keywords define alignment as absolute position within container
      - `center`, `start`, `end`, etc
    - **baseline alignment**: keywords define alignment as a relationship among the baselines of multiple alignment subjects within an alignment context
      - `baseline`, `first baseline`, `last baseline`
    - **distributed alignment**: keywords define alignment as a distribution of space among alignment subjects.
      - `stretch`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`
  
 If **baseline alignment** is specified on a grid item whose size in that axis:
  - depends on the size of an intrinsically-sized track 
    - aka the intrinsically-sized track depends on both the item’s size and baseline alignment, creating a cyclic dependency),
    - that item does not participate in baseline alignment,
    - instead uses its fallback alignment as if that were originally specified.
    - For this purpose, <flex> track sizes count as “intrinsically-sized” when the grid container has an indefinite size in the relevant axis.

## 11.4. Block-axis Alignment: the align-self and align-items properties

All alignment keywords you can find [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#alignment-values).

`align-items` sets the default value for `align-self` for all _grid-items_
`align-self`: In grid layouts, it aligns an item inside its grid area on the _block axis_.
  - common values are: [(`stretch is absent`?)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self)
    - `center`
    - `start`
    - `end`
- Value categories:
  - **ARE THESE THE SAME AS IN THE INLINE AXES??**

If **baseline alignment** is specified on a grid item whose size in that axis:
- depends on the size of an intrinsically-sized track 
  - aka the intrinsically-sized track depends on both the item’s size and baseline alignment, creating a cyclic dependency),
  - that item does not participate in baseline alignment,
  - instead uses its fallback alignment as if that were originally specified.
  - For this purpose, <flex> track sizes count as “intrinsically-sized” when the grid container has an indefinite size in the relevant axis.

property on the grid item or  property on the grid container, as defined in [CSS-ALIGN-3].

## 11.5. Aligning the Grid: the `justify-content` and `align-content` properties

If the grid’s outer edges do not correspond to the grid container’s content edges (for example, if no columns are flex-sized),
the grid tracks are aligned within the content box according to the justify-content and align-content properties on the grid container.

EXAMPLE 46
```css
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid: 12rem 12rem 12rem 12rem / 10rem 10rem 10rem 10rem;
    justify-content: end;   /* inline axis to the end */
    align-content: center;  /* block-axis center      */
}
```

EXAMPLE 47

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  /* 3-row / 4-column grid container */
  grid: repeat(3, auto) / repeat(4, auto);
  gap: 10px;
  align-content: space-around;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item1 { grid-column: 1 / 5; }
.item2 { grid-column: 1 / 3; grid-row: 2 / 4; }
.item3 { grid-column: 3 / 5; }
/* last two items auto-place into the last two grid cells */
```
