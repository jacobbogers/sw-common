By default, _grid items_ stretch to fill their _grid area_.

- IF `justify-self` or `align-self` compute to a value other than `stretch` or `margins` are `auto` THEN
  -  _grid items_ will _auto-size_ to fit their contents.
-  END

## 11.1 Gutters: the `row-gap`, `column-ga`p, and `gap` properties

- long-hand: `gap`
- short-hand: `row-gap`, `column-gap`
- Define _gutters_ between grid rows and grid columns.
- Gutters only appear between tracks of the implicit grid.
- there is no gutter before the first track or after the last track.

Values are:
- `normal`: for the grid this is 0px
- `<length-percentage>`

Shorthand `gap` = `<row-gap-value>` `<column-gap-value>`


## 11.2. Aligning with auto margins

- Auto margins on grid items similar to auto margins in block flow.
- Auto margins absorb positive free space prior to alignment `justify-content`, `align-content`, `justify-item`, `align-item`.
- Overflowing elements ignore their auto margins.

## 11.3. Inline-axis Alignment: the `justify-self` and `justify-items` properties
