
# 11 Alignment and spacing

By default, _grid items_ stretch to fill their _grid area_.

- IF `justify-self` or `align-self` compute to a value other than `stretch` or `margins` are `auto` THEN
  -  _grid items_ will _auto-size_ to fit their contents.
-  END

## 11.1 Gutters: the `row-gap`, `column-ga`p, and `gap` properties

- long-hand: `gap`
- short-hand: `row-gap`, `column-gap`
- Define _gutters_ between grid rows and grid columns.
- Gutters only appear between tracks of the implicit grid.
- there is no gutter before the first track or after the last track.

Values are:
- `normal`: for the grid this is 0px
- `<length-percentage>`

Shorthand `gap` = `<row-gap-value>` `<column-gap-value>`


## 11.2. Aligning with auto margins

- Auto margins on grid items similar to auto margins in block flow.
- Auto margins absorb positive free space prior to alignment `justify-content`, `align-content`, `justify-item`, `align-item`.
- Overflowing elements ignore their auto margins.

## 11.3. Inline-axis Alignment: the `justify-self` and `justify-items` properties

All alignment keywords you can find [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#alignment-values).

`justify-items` sets the default value for `justify-self` for all _grid-items_ 
- `justify-self`: In grid layouts, it aligns an item inside its grid area on the _inline axis_.
  - common values are:
    - `stretch` (default)
    - `center`
    - `start`
    - `end`
  - Value catogires:
    - **positional alignment**: keywords define alignment as absolute position within container
      - `center`, `start`, `end`, etc
    - **baseline alignment**: keywords define alignment as a relationship among the baselines of multiple alignment subjects within an alignment context
      - `baseline`, `first baseline`, `last baseline`
    - **distributed alignment**: keywords define alignment as a distribution of space among alignment subjects.
      - `stretch`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`
  
 If **baseline alignment** is specified on a grid item whose size in that axis:
  - depends on the size of an intrinsically-sized track 
    - aka the intrinsically-sized track depends on both the item’s size and baseline alignment, creating a cyclic dependency),
    - that item does not participate in baseline alignment,
    - instead uses its fallback alignment as if that were originally specified.
    - For this purpose, <flex> track sizes count as “intrinsically-sized” when the grid container has an indefinite size in the relevant axis.

## 11.4. Block-axis Alignment: the align-self and align-items properties

All alignment keywords you can find [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#alignment-values).

`align-items` sets the default value for `align-self` for all _grid-items_
`align-self`: In grid layouts, it aligns an item inside its grid area on the _block axis_.
  - common values are: [(`stretch is absent`?)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self)
    - `center`
    - `start`
    - `end`
- Value categories:
  - **ARE THESE THE SAME AS IN THE INLINE AXES??**

If **baseline alignment** is specified on a grid item whose size in that axis:
- depends on the size of an intrinsically-sized track 
  - aka the intrinsically-sized track depends on both the item’s size and baseline alignment, creating a cyclic dependency),
  - that item does not participate in baseline alignment,
  - instead uses its fallback alignment as if that were originally specified.
  - For this purpose, <flex> track sizes count as “intrinsically-sized” when the grid container has an indefinite size in the relevant axis.

property on the grid item or  property on the grid container, as defined in [CSS-ALIGN-3].

## 11.5. Aligning the Grid: the `justify-content` and `align-content` properties

If the grid’s outer edges do not correspond to the grid container’s content edges (for example, if no columns are flex-sized),
the grid tracks are aligned within the content box according to the justify-content and align-content properties on the grid container.

EXAMPLE 46
```css
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid: 12rem 12rem 12rem 12rem / 10rem 10rem 10rem 10rem;
    justify-content: end;   /* inline axis to the end */
    align-content: center;  /* block-axis center      */
}
```

EXAMPLE 47

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  /* 3-row / 4-column grid container */
  grid: repeat(3, auto) / repeat(4, auto);
  gap: 10px;
  align-content: space-around;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item1 { grid-column: 1 / 5; }
.item2 { grid-column: 1 / 3; grid-row: 2 / 4; }
.item3 { grid-column: 3 / 5; }
/* last two items auto-place into the last two grid cells */
```

Layout in 2 steps: (from left to right)

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 820px;">

</div>

## 11.6 Grid container Baselines

The first (last) baselines of a grid container are determined as follows:

- Find the first (last) row of the grid container containing at least one grid item.

- IF grid item(s) intersecting this row THEN
    - participate in baseline alignment in that row,
    - the grid container’s baseline set is generated from the shared alignment baseline of those grid items.
- ELSE
    - The grid container’s first (last) baseline set is generated from the alignment baseline of the first (last) grid item in row-major grid order (according to the writing mode of the grid container).
    - IF the grid item has no alignment baseline in the grid’s inline axis THEN
      - one is first synthesized from its border edges.
    - END
- END 

- IF 
  - the grid container does not contain any grid items 
  - the grid container has no first (last) baseline set
  - THEN
    - one is synthesized if needed according to the rules of its alignment context
- END

**Grid-modified document order (grid order)** (is this raw document orderf?) is the order in which grid items are encountered when traversing the grid’s grid cells.

If two items are encountered at the same time (because they have the same "order"?), they are taken in **order-modified document order**.

If the box contributing a baseline has an overflow value that allows scrolling, the box must be treated as being in its initial scroll position for the purpose of determining its baseline.

When determining the baseline of a table cell (The table (cell) is a grid-item?), a grid container provides a baseline just as a line box or table-row does. [CSS2]
