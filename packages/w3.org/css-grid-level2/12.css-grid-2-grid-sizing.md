## 12 Grid Sizing

This section defines the grid sizing algorithm
    - determines the size of all grid tracks. 
    - determines the size of the entire grid.

Each track has:
- Specified minimum and maximum sizing functions (which may be the same).
- Each sizing function is:
  - A fixed sizing function (`<length>` or resolvable `<percentage>`).
  - An intrinsic sizing function:
    - `min-content`
    - `max-content`
    - `auto`
    - `fit-content()`

**Outcome**: The grid sizing algorithm defines how to resolve these sizing constraints into used track sizes.

### 12.1. Grid Sizing Algorithm

Note:_Placement of _grid items_ occurs before sizing_

1. First, the track sizing algorithm is used to resolve the sizes of the _grid columns_. Apply optionally `align-content`
2. Next, the track sizing algorithm resolves the sizes of _grid rows_.  Apply optionally `justify-content`
3. Next, If the `min-content` contribution of any grid item has changed based on the row sizes and alignment calculated in step 2, re-resolve the sizes of the grid columns with the new min-content and max-content contributions (once only).

5. TODO

### 12.2. Track Sizing Terminology

This Terminology applies to both Horizontal or Vertical tracks independently.

- **`min track sizing function`** 
  - IF the track was sized with a `minmax()` function, it is the FIRST argument of the function
  - ELSE IF the track was sized with `flex` THEN it is `auto`
  - ELSE IF the track was sized with `fit-content()` THEN it is `auto`
  - ELSE it is `<the track sizing function>`

- **`max track sizing function`** 
  - IF the track was sized with a `minmax()` function, it is the SECOND argument of the function
  - ELSE it is `<the track sizing function>`
  - NOTE:
    - IF `<the track sizing function>` = `auto` THEN it is `max-content`
    - IF `<the track sizing function>` = `fit-content()` THEN it is `max-content`
  
Question:
  What does [this](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#max-track-sizing-function) mean[(bold part):
  
> _In all cases, treat auto and fit-content() as max-content, **except where specified otherwise for fit-content()**._

- **`available grid space`**
  - Independently in each dimension
    - IF the _grid container_ size is _definite_ THEN 
      - use the size of its content box
    - ELSE IF the _grid_container_ is being sized under `<min-content contraint>` OR `<max-content constraint>` THEN
      - _available grid space_ is that constraint and definite 
    - END
  - NOTE:
    - In all c
  - ELSE it is `<the track sizing function>`
  - NOTE:
    - In All cases clamp the _available grid space_ according to the grid container’s `min-width`/`max-width`/`height` properties, if they are definite.

- **`Free space`**
  - Equal to _available grid space_ MINUS the _base size(s)_ MINUS _gutters_
    - Floored at 0
    - IF _available grid space_ is indefinite  then _free space_ is indefinite as well

- **`Span Count`**
  - Equal to _available grid space_ MINUS the _base size(s)_ MINUS _gutters_
    - Floored at 0
    - IF _available grid space_ is indefinite  then _free space_ is indefinite as well

### 12.3 Track Sizing Algorithm

- _Used track size_ is calculated from the _min track sizing function_ and the _max track sizing function_.
- Each track has a _base size_ (a length), the algorithm will grow this length through various stages until:
  - it reaches the tracks final size
  - it has a growth limit (aka the maximum size the track can ever be)

There are 5 steps:

- 1. §12.4 Initialize Track size
- 2. §12.5 Resolve intrinsic track sizes
- 3. §12.6 Maximize Tracks
- 4. §12.7 Expand Flexible tracks
- 5. §12.8 Expand Stretched auto Tracks

### 12.4 Initialize Track sizes

Initialize _base size_ and _growth limit_:

For each track, if the track’s _min track sizing function_ is:
  - **A fixed sizing function**
    - Resolve to an absolute length (definite) and use that size as the track’s initial _base size_.
  - **An intrinsic sizing function** (`min-content`, `max-content`, `auto`, `fit-content()`)
    - Use base size 0

For each track, if the track’s _max track sizing function_ is:
  - **A fixed sizing function**
    - Resolve to an absolute length and use that size as the track’s initial growth limit.
  - **A intrinsic sizing function** OR **A flexible `fr` sizing function** 
    - Use an initial growth limit of infinity

Note: IF _growth limit_ is less then _base size_ make _growth limit_ equal to the base size

### 12.5 Resolve intrinsic track sizes

Tracks sized with an intrinsic sizing function:
- `min-content`
- `max-content`
- `auto`
- `fit-content()`

In the relevant direction:
  - First resolve item sizes that are wholly contained in the single track (`span 1`)
  - Secondly add the space requirements of items that span multiple tracks, 
    - evenly distributing the extra space across those tracks insofar as possible.

Remember that if `<max track sizing function>` with the value `fit-content()` and `auto` are treated as `max-content`

Resolve intrinsic track to absolute length.

#### Steps:

##### 1. Add additional margins to _baseline aligned_ items (with a _baseline sharing group_) so their baselines line up.

- Consider these _margins_ as part of the items intrinsic size for the purpose of track sizing
- Grid items whose own size depends on the size of an intrinsically-sized track do not participate in baseline alignment.

##### 2. Size tracks to fit items with `span 1`: 

- The track has an `<intrinsic track sizing function>`
- The track has not a `<flexible sizing function>`

###### 2.1 For `min-contents` minimum

- If the track has `<min track sizing function>` = `min-content`
  - THEN
    - set `<base size>` to maximum of the `min-content` contributions
    - floor at zero

###### 2.2 For `max-contents` minimum

- If the track has `<min track sizing function>` = `max-content`
  - THEN
    - set `<base size>`to maximum of the `max-content` contributions

###### 2.3 For `auto` minimums

Note: `<minimum contribution>` of an item is the smallest outer size it can have.

- If the track has `<min track sizing function>` = `auto`
  - If the _grid container_ is sized under `<min-content constraint>`
    - THEN set `<base size>` to maximum of _limited min-contents contributions_
  - ELSE If the _grid container_ is sized under `<max-content constraint>`
    - THEN set `<base size>` to maximum of _limited max-contents contributions_
  - ELSE
    - set track `<base size>` to  maximum of the item's `<minimum contribution>`
  - END 
  - All above track size calculations are floored by the `<minimum contribution>`
- END

###### 2.4 For `min-content` maximums:

- IF track has `<max track sizing function>` =`min-content`
  - set `<growth limit>` to the maximum of `<min-content contributions>`

###### 2.5 For `max-content` maximums:

- IF track has `<max track sizing function>` =`max-content`
  - set `<growth limit>` to the maximum of `<max-content contributions>`
- IF track has `<max track sizing function>` =`fit-content`
  - clamp this growth by value of `fit-content`

Note: if `<growth limit>` smaller then `<base size>`


#### 3. Increase track-size for spanning over `<content-sized tracks>`

- Items that do:
  - have **span 2**
  - not span `fr` track

##### 3.1 For intrinsic minimums
- IF track has`<min track sizing function>` = `<intrinsic>`
  - THEN `<§ 12.5.1 distribute extra space>` to accommodate item `<minimum contribution>`.
- If the grid container is sized under a `min-content` constraint 
- OR
- If the grid container is sized under a `max-content` constraint
  - use the item's `<limited min-content contributions>` instead of `<minimum contributions>`

- IF span > 2
  - `<upper limit>` of `<limited min-content/max-content contribution>`
    - = SUM `<fixed max track sizing functions>` covered by the span.


##### 3.2 For content-based minimums

Next:
- Increase the `<base size>` with a `<min track sizing function>` (`min-content`, `max-content`) by _distribution extra space_ as needed to account for items `<min-content contributions>`.


##### 3.3 For max-content minimums:
Next:
- IF `<min track sizing function>` = `auto` | `max-content`
  - IF _grid container_ is sized under `<max-content constraint>`,
  -  THEN increase the `<base size>` of tracks by distributing _extra space_ to fit the items' `<limited max-content contributions>`.

In all cases,
IF `<min track sizing function>` = `max-content` 
 THEN  increase `<base size>` by distributing _extra space_ to account for these items' `max-content` contributions.


##### 3.4 Intermezzo 

If at this point any `<growth limit>` is now less than its `<base size>`, increase its growth limit to match its base size.


##### 3.5 For intrinsic maximums
Next:
- If track has `<intrinsic max tracking sizing function>` increase `<growth limit>` by distributing _extra space_ 
- This must cover all item's `<min-content contributions>`.
- Mark any tracks whose `<growth limit>` changed from _infinite_ to _finite_ in this step as _infinitely growable_ for the next step

**Why does the infinitely growable flag exist?**

You\'re wondering about the existence of "SpanGroupInWhichMaxBreadthWasMadeFinite" in the Microsoft algorithm, right?

Consider the following case:

Two "auto" tracks (i.e. minmax(min-content, max-content) minmax(min-content, max-content)).
Item 1 is in track 1, and has min-content = max-content = 10.
Item 2 spans tracks 1 and 2, and has min-content = 30, max-content = 100.

After resolving min-content/max-content for the first item, we have this.

track 1: base size = 10 growth limit = 10

track 2: base size = 0 growth limit = infinity

Then we resolve min-content/max-content for the second item.

Phase 1 (3.1?) sets the BASE SIZE of track 2 to 20 so that the two track\'s BASE SIZES sum to 30.

Phase 2 does nothing because there are no relevant tracks.

Phase 3 sets the GROWTH LIMIT of track 2 to 20 so that the two track\'s GROWTH LIMITS sum to 30.

In phase 4, we need to grow the sum of the growth limits by 70 to accommodate item 2.
Two options are:

1. Grow each track’s growth limit equally,
  and end up with growth limits = [45, 55].
2. Grow only the second track’s growth limit,
  and end up with growth limits = [10, 90].

By not considering the just-set growth limit as a constraint during space distribution
(i.e. by treating it as infinity),
we get the second result,
which we considered a better result because the first track remains sized exactly to the first item.
```

##### 3.6 For max-content maximums
Next:
-IF `<max track sizing function>` = `max-content` 
  -THEN
     - Increase `<growth limit>` if this track by distributing extra space for item's `<max-content contributions>`
     - LIMIT growth of `fit-content()` track by `fit-content()` argument
    

##### 3.7 Repeat

Repeat incrementally for items with greater spans until all items have been considered.

#### 4 Increase sizes to accommodate spanning items crossing flexible tracks:

Next, 
 - Repeat the previous step (3.1 - 3.7) instead:
   - Considering all items that do span a track with a flexible sizing function
   - while distributing space only to flexible tracks (i.e. treating all other tracks as having a fixed sizing function)
   - Considering together, rather than grouped by span size
  
Condition:
- IF the sum of the flexible sizing functions of all flexible tracks **spanned by the item** is greater than zero
  - THEN distributing space to such tracks according to the ratios of their flexible sizing functions rather than distributing space equally.

#### 5 Post production

- IF any track still has an infinite growth limit 
-  THEN (because, for example, it had no items placed in it or it is a flexible track), set its `<growth limit>` to its `<base size>`.

#### 12.5.1. Distributing Extra Space Across Spanned Tracks 

Because of intrinsic size contributions ( a set of) → Increasing the affected sizes of a set of tracks → by _distribute extra space_ amongst them.


##### Step 1

- Maintain separately for each affected `<base size>` or `<growth limit>` a planned increase,
- Initially set to 0.
  
##### Step 2

For each considered item,

###### Step 2.1

Find the space to distribute: Subtract the corresponding size (`<base size>` or `<growth limit>`) of every spanned track from the item’s `<size contribution>` to find the item’s `<remaining size contribution>`.

Constraints: 
- For infinite `<growth limits>`, substitute the track’s `<base size>`.
- Floor it at zero.

Summary:
- `<extra-space>` (alias `<remaining size contribution>`) = max(0, `<size-contribution>` - ∑track-sizes the item spans)

###### Step 2.2

Distribute space up to limits:

- Find the item-incurred increase for each spanned track with an affected size by:
  -  REPEAT 
     -  distributing the space equally among such tracks,
  -  UNTIL `<affected size>` + `<item-incurred increase>` reaches its limit 
  -  freezing a track’s `<item-incurred increase>
  -  continuing to grow the unfrozen tracks as needed.

- For `<base sizes>`, the limit is its `<growth limit>`. 
- For `<growth limits>`, 
  - IF marked as `<infinitely growable>` 
    - THEN
      - the limit is _infinity_
    - ELSE 
      - equal to `<growth limit>`
  - END

Note: 
- IF the affected size was a `<growth limit>` and the track is not marked `<infinitely growable>`,
  - THEN 
    - each `<item-incurred increase>` will be zero.

###### **Step 2.3**

Distribute space beyond limits: 

- If space remains after all tracks are frozen
  - THEN unfreeze and continue to distribute space (Step 2.2) to the `<item-incurred increase>` of the following:

###### Choice/Step 2.3.1
  - IF 
      - some of the spanned track(s) have an `<max track sizing function>` = `<intrinsic>` 
      -  AND
         -  and accommodating `<minimum contributions>` 
         -  OR
         -  accommodating `<min-content contributions>`
  - THEN 
    - distribute space to the `<item-incurred increase>` item spanning these/this track(s)
  - ELSE
    - distribute space to the `<item-incurred increase>` item considering all tracks it spans

###### Choice/Step 2.3.2

- IF 
  - some the spanned track(s) have `<max track sizing function>` = `max-content` 
  - AND
  - accommodating `<max-content contributions>` items
- THEN
  - distribute space to the `<item-incurred increase>` item spanning these/this track(s)
- ELSE
  - distribute space to the `<item-incurred increase>` item considering all tracks it spans.


###### Choice/Step 2.3.3



- IF 
  - handling `<intrinsic growth limit>`: 
- THEN 
  - distribute space to the `<item-incurred increase>` item considering all tracks it spans.
- END

###### **Summary 2.3:**

Note: 
- This step prioritizes space distribution to feed the track's `<min track sizing functions>` beyond their current `<growth limits>` 
- The prioritization is based on the track's <`max track sizing functions`>.

###### Step 2.4

For each affected track,

-If the track’s `<item-incurred increase>` the track’s `<planned increase>` 
  - THEN `<planned increase>` = `<item-incurred increase>`

##### Step 3. Update the tracks' `<affected sizes>`

Update the tracks' `<affected sizes>` by adding in the `<planned increase>` so that the next round of space distribution will account for the increase.

- If the `<affected size>` IS an `<infinite growth limit>`, 
  - THEN track's `<affected size>` = `<base size>` + `<planned increase>`


### 12.6. Maximize Tracks

- WHILE  _free space_ is positive
  - distribute it equally a part of the free-space to the `<base sizes>` of all tracks,
  - FOR-EACH all unfrozen track
    - IF track reached growth limit
      - freeze track
    - END IF
  - END FOR
- END WHILE

Note to self: above algorithm can be a problem, you can be left with more
free space after all tracks are frozen.

- IF sizing the grid container under a `<max-content constraint>`, THEN
  - the free space is infinite;
- ELSE IF sizing under a `<min-content constraint>`
  - the free space is zero.
- END IF

- IF grid container is limited by `max-width` and/or `max-height` THEN
  - IF grid `<inner size>` overflow above limited because of § 12.6 THEN
    - REDO § 12.6 with `<available space>` = `<inner size>` as limited by `max-width` and/or `max-height`
  - END IF
- END IF

### 12.7. Expand Flexible Tracks

Preamble: different then in the spec, we discuss § 12.7.1 first then the overall algorithm of step § 12.7 (aka § 12.7.0)

#### 12.7.1 Find the Size of an `fr` (this is the hypothetical fr size)

This algorithm finds the largest size that an fr unit can be without exceeding the target size.

It must be called with a set of _grid tracks_ and some quantity of _space to fill_.

The text is converted to pseudo code below.

```javascript
// initially pass a deep copy of "tracks" as first argument
 function findSizeOfFr(tracks: GridTracks, spaceToFill: number): number {

   const nonFlexibleGridTracks = tracks.filter(haveNoFr);
   const flexibleTracks = tracks.filter(haveFr);

   let leftOverSpace = <space-to-fill> - nonFlexibleGridTracks.reduce((sum, track) => sum+track.baseSize; 0);
   let flexFactorSum = flexibleTracks.reduce((sum, tracks)=> sum+track.flexFactor, 0);
   
   flexFactorSum = max(1, flexFactorSum);

   let hypotheticalFrSize = leftOverSpace/flexFactorSum;
   
   let changed = false;
   for (track of flexibleTracks) {
      if ( track.flexFactor * hypotheticalFrSize  < track.baseSize ) {
            delete track.fr // track is now inflexible
            // i thought about recursive call here,  return findSizeOfFr(...) BUT BUT BUT
            // if this reduces leftOverSpace AND reduces flexFactorSum , so the new ratio hypotheticalFrSize is uncertain
            // so test all flexibleTracks and use changed marker
            changed = true
      } 
   }
   
   if (changed === true) { // re-run algorithm
      return findSizeOfFr(tracks, spaceToFill);
   }
   return hypotheticalFrSize;
}
```

#### 12.7.0 (this is artificially introduced , to change the order of explanation as discussed in the official spec)

Sizes flexible tracks using the largest value it can assign to an `fr` without exceeding the `<available space>`.

- 1. First find the grids `<flex fraction>` (see § 7.2.4).
- 2.
  - IF
    - the _free space_ is zero
  - OR
    - the _grid container_ is sized under `<min-content constraint>`
  - THEN
    - the `used <flex fraction>` is zero
  - ELSE IF _free space_ is _definite_
  - THEN  
    - the `used <flex-fraction>` = *(§ 12.7.1) finding the size of an `fr`* using (all grid tracks, `<space to fill>` of the `<available space>`)
  - ELSE (_free space_ is _INdefinite_)
    - the `used <flex-fraction> = maxOf(a,b)` see `maxOf(a,b)` algorithm below
  - END  

```javascript

      - `a` = (For each flexible track) = IF _`<flex factor>` > 1 THEN `<base size> of track / <flex factor> of track ELSE <base size> of track
      - `b` = (For each grid item that crosses a flexible track) finding the size of an `fr` using all the grid tracks that the item crosses and a space to fill of the item’s max-content contribution.
```
