In order:

- Read § 12.2. Terminology
- Read § 12.3. Track Sizing Algorithm (this is summary of steps).
- Read § 12.4. Initialize Track Sizes
- Read § 12.5. Resolve Intrinsic Track Sizes
- Read § 12.6. Maximize Tracks
- Read § 12.7. Expand Flexible Tracks
- Read § 12.8. Stretch auto Tracks

As last step return here to:

- Read § 12.1 Grid Sizing Algorithm

## 12 Grid Sizing

This section defines the grid sizing algorithm
    - determines the size of all grid tracks. 
    - determines the size of the entire grid.

Each track has:
- Specified minimum and maximum sizing functions (which may be the same).
- Each sizing function is:
  - A fixed sizing function (`<length>` or resolvable `<percentage>`).
  - An intrinsic sizing function:
    - `min-content`
    - `max-content`
    - `auto`
    - `fit-content()`

**Outcome**: The grid sizing algorithm defines how to resolve these sizing constraints into used track sizes.

### 12.1. Grid Sizing Algorithm

Note:_Placement of _grid items_ occurs before sizing_


1. First, the track sizing algorithm is used to resolve the sizes of the _grid columns_. Apply optionally `align-content`
2. Next, the track sizing algorithm resolves the sizes of _grid rows_.  Apply optionally `justify-content`
3. Next, If the `min-content` contribution of any grid item has changed based on the row sizes and alignment calculated in step 2, re-resolve the sizes of the grid columns with the new min-content and max-content contributions (once only).
